# Proposal
## Bio-Inspired wing morphing to improve the performance of a glider.
**Objective of the Proposal:**

1.Study the aerodynamics of wing characteristics of owls.
2.Optimization of wingâ€™s geometry to increase the performance of gliders.
**Short Description:**

1.The dimensions of wings geometry are chosen as reported in reference[1].
2.Produce and Simulate CAD models to get aerodynamic characteristics.
3.Find the Short-comings. 
4.Optimization to subdue the short-comings and.
5.Compare the above produced characteristics to the Sparrow Hawk wing.
